# OpenEO_DROUGHT  
RESPONSE OF VEGETATION INDICES TO DROUGHT   
Authors: Elia Quirós and Laura Fragoso-Campón.   
The proposal of this study was accepted for a OpenEO Platform Research Grant.  
The preliminary results were presented at the LPS22 openEO Platform User consultation event.  
The initial objective of the study was is to establish, from a set of VIs available on the OpenEO platform, which ones have the highest correlation with drought events in the study area. Although this was the first intention, in the end, due to problems of lack of access to the desired dates, the objective of the work had to be reconverted to the search for the correlation of a vegetation index with the meteorological values of a time series of data, without having any episode of severe drought within it. This correlation was analysed according to vegetation type in order to attempt to determine the behaviour of the vegetation index under meteorology according to each type.
